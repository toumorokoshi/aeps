# AEP Editions

This AEP describes how the AEP specification is versioned.

## Edition-based versioning

AEPs will be published in editions, similar but not identical to specifications
such as those for the C++ or Rust programming languages:

- The specification will not change for a non-preview edition after it is
  published.
- The naming of the edition will be based on the year in which it is published
  (e.g. `aep-2025`).
- Upon publishing a non-preview edition, the current preview edition will be removed,
  and the next preview edition will be created (e.g. aep-2027-preview). This
  preview edition will accumulate changes until the next edition is published.
- AEP editions **MAY** have patch version updates which adhere to semantic
  versioning (e.g. aep-2025.25).
  - The patch version will only contain fixes to typos and clarification on
    existing guidance.
- Editions will be published every 2 years.

## Breaking changes between editions

Although not strictly related to versioning, the AEP specification will
generally strive to minimize breaking changes, even across editions.

## First-party clients and tooling

_NOTE_: This proposal only applies to AEP first-party clients. Third party open
source projects or organizations are governed outside of this project, and may
have their own guarantees.

### Client versioning

- Clients _SHOULD_ adhere to [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0](https://semver.org/)

### Client and edition compatibilty

The newest major version of clients and tools **MUST** be compatible with, at
minimum, the 3 latest non-preview AEP editions.

The following guidance applies to the most recent major versions of clients:

- Clients may provide different support guarantees for older major versions.
- Each major version will state which AEP editions are supported by those
  clients.
- This guidance does not apply to accepting PRs on older major versions: those
  may be accepted for any maintained branch of the project, at the discretion
  of the client maintainers.
- Clients and tools may support features in preview editions, but support for
  preview edition features in all clients and tools is not guaranteed.

## Examples of AEP specification changes

The following are examples of specification changes:

- renaming a field (e.g. `name` to `path`)
- changing the syntax for a filter or query language
- updating versioning guidance
- adding a new standard method
- removing guidance
- updating a design pattern (e.g. singletons or revisions)
- adding a new design pattern

## Rationale

### Why an edition-based scheme

The AEPs have two goals that are difficult to achieve in concert:

1. Providing a set of modern best practices for remote APIs.
2. Providing a stable ecosystem of tooling that organizations can adopt for
   their use.

This is due to the need to constantly evolve the best practices, which may
contradict older best practices and therefore result in a breaking change.
These breaking changes can be difficult for both services producing these APIs
to adopt, as well as complicate clients with multiple different code paths to
handle these different versions of clients.

An edition-based system will help provide clear expectations around the cadence
in which breaking changes could be introduced, as well as act as an anchor on
which other durations could be based (for example, support for a number of
editions in major versions of clients).

### Why clients are versioned separately

Although clients are expected to support recent AEP editions and could have a
similar versioning scheme, clients may also need to introduce breaking changes
for a variety of reasons unrelated to a new AEP edition, including:

1. An interface change in the client itself.
2. A change to support a new integration or interface (for example, supporting
   a new version of the Terraform SDK, or a major version of the MCP server
   protocol).

This necessitates the ability to express these changes to consumers. As such,
decoupling the client version from the AEP editions is a critical requirement.
